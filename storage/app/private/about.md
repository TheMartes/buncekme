# Matej Bunček
I'm a developer based in Europe, Slovakia. 🇸🇰

I'm Software / Systems Engineer by hearth. I love to make performant software and create native experiences. Throughout my carreer I was working on multiple projects mainly in [online betting industry](https://www.betsys.com/) but I was also working on [social media platform](https://www.combyne.com/) & classic B2B SAAS apps.

On my freetime I like to make some side gigs. This website is one of them. But I also did Kubernetes GUI management tool, for easier managements of kubernetes clusters and also CRM Management SAAS called Boston.

I like to drive cars. Whenever possible I'm hitting some race tracks (mainly [slovakiaring](https://slovakiaring.sk/)) on the weekend. I drive 2018 Ford Focus RS (350hp, 470nm) and I often share big passion for this hobby. I used to also run Mechanical Keyboards Community in Czechia & Slovakia.
