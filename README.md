Hey, this is source code to my personal website. It's based on laravel and heavily underutilized. You can fork this and use on your own if you wish to.

## Contributing
All of the markdown files are stored n storage/app/private/. Those are then being taken by controller and rendered as html.

## Building
- To install all composer dependencies run `composer install`.
- Then run `npm install` to install tailwind and vite.
- To compile everything run `npm run dev`.
- To run the app run `php artisan serve`.

Written in laravel, deployed via laravel cloud.

## Todo
- [x] Add misc pages
- [x] Write about page
- [x] Finish Footer
- [ ] Add Reponsive-ish design
- [ ] Add more links to About page
